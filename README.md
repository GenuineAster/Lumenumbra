After 72 hours of work, three shirts, one night of oversleeping, many cups of coffee, lots of bug fixing, stress...

I present to you... **Lumenumbra**!

(Made during the first SFML game jam)

###### Version: 0.1 Beta

# Gameplay:
Lumenumbra is a minimalistic lighting-based 2D game.
You play as a source of light. Making use of the shadows you create to get around the world.
Some objects can be seen, and create shadows, but others can only be seen in the shadows.

# Features:
* The levels are written in JSON, this makes it very easy for users to add their own levels.
* Awesome lighting effects make the game look 3D!
* Two levels of awesomeness!
